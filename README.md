## Technologies Used

This lab utilizes various technologies and programming languages, including:

- Python
- PyCryptodome
- RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms
- Git

## Features

- **Cryptographic Implementations**: Demonstrates the implementation of various cryptographic algorithms like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman.
- **Secure Communication**: Implements secure messaging between different roles using encryption.
- **Key Management**: Includes a key management service for generating, renewing, and revoking cryptographic keys.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository and set it up, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/norsechurros/InformationSecurity_Lab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd InformationSecurity_Lab
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any). For example, if you are using `PyCryptodome`, you can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```

## Usage

To run the various implementations, execute the Python scripts in the project. Hereâ€™s a basic example to run one of the scripts:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

Make sure to replace `your_script.py` with the actual script name.
